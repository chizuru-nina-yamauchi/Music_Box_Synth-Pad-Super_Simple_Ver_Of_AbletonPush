# Music_Box_Synth-Pad-Super_Simple_Ver_Of_AbletonPush

This is the idea for Final Project with Java.

Additional features we could implement
- User authentication(Ex. Three times fail to log in, the user account will be locked for 5 minutes) or going back to main page)
- Transaction to donate or buy the music box
- Volume knob features(The user can change the volume. Question: How?)
- Tempo features(The user can change the tempo(BPM). Question. How?) 
- Record and Play the recorded music features(The user can record and play the music they made(They just press the buttons on web app))
- MIDI input features(I think this is very advanced for us but just writing down here)

Another web app we could check and implement some features from them

I think it is a bit more advanced than our project. But we could implement some features from them.

Concerns
- How to implement the sound features
I would produce, 15 second each, 4 drums, 4 bass, and 4 melody 4 Chords with specific tempo(ex. 120bpm) audio files with music Software Ableton Live Suit.(How many audio files, what kind of sounds, default tempo is flexible)

-How all the audio file would be synchronized to each other on time when the user press the button randomly?
Question:Are we using Thread synchronization or other method to synchronize the audio files?

-How the volume becomes louder and lower with Java?

-How the tempo becomes faster and slower with Java?

Audio Play, Stop and Pause Function
https://github.com/chizuru-nina-yamauchi/Simple_Java_Sound_Audio_Player
I made a simple console based audio player with Java(Bro Code's YouTube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyZQVJiARTQ). 
Probably we could use and modify this function for backend to build our project to play and pause the audio files?

(Just to imagine about the project)
